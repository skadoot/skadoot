## 👋 Hello, I'm Tyler Lewis!

📍 I'm from Wales and currently based here as well.

🎓 I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Aberystwyth University, pursuing my Bachelor's Degree.

💻 I have a strong interest in web development and object-oriented programming. I particularly enjoy working with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

🏆 One of my notable achievements was serving as the Quality Assurance manager for my year two group project, where we achieved an impressive mark of 76%.

🔧 When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving into the world of mechanics. I have a passion for automotive engineering and enjoy working on my own car. I also love taking on various DIY projects around the house.

🌍 Fun fact: I'm fluent in both English and Welsh, and my car is 13 years older than me!

📫 Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, opportunities, or just want to connect!
