## 🚗 Car Enthusiast

In my spare time, I trade my keyboard for a wrench and delve into the world of mechanics. My trusty '90 Mazda MX5 is my canvas, and I love DIY projects that let me uncover the secrets under the hood.

## 🌍 Multilingual

Fluent in English and Welsh, I'm also challenging myself to learn German. It's not just about mastering code; languages open up new horizons too.

## 🌱 Always Learning

I'm fueled by a great curiosity to understand how things work. Whether it's pulling apart car engines or diving into software architecture, I'm driven by the desire to unravel the inner workings of our world. Exploring the intricate details is not just a hobby; it's my way of learning, and it keeps me excited about every project I take on. Join me on this journey of discovery! 🚀
