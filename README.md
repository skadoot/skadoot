# Shwmae! 👋

I'm Tyler, a passionate Computer Science student at Aberystwyth University in my third year. I specialize in software development/engineering with a keen interest in cryptography, secure systems, and cyber security.

## 📝 About Me

🎓 Education: Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Aberystwyth University.

💡 Interests: I love delving into various aspects of technology, including machine learning, AI, and cybersecurity. My current focus includes exploring the intersection of these fields.

## 🧠 Interests

I love clasical music and soundtracks, and I'm a big fan of composers such as Hans Zimmer, Steve Jablonsky, Max Richter, and more. I'm also into cars and engines, I currently own a 1990 Mazda MX5 that I love to work on in my spare time, and I've taught myself a lot about maintaining cars since I've owned it. I enjoying playing video games occasionaly, and lately I've been enjoying games like Fallout New Vegas, Minecraft, and Hearts of Iron 4. I particularly enjoy creative hands on things where I can learn about how something works, fix things, or be creative.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- 🚀 Experience with: Java, Kotlin, Android, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- 🛠️ Tools I use: Maven, Gradle, JetBrains Suite, Android Studio
- 🌐 Currently exploring: Resilience techniques, Secure systems, Cryptography, Machine Learning, AI, Android Development, C++, and C#

## 🚧 Current Projects

- [ChatMachine](https://skadoot.github.io/): A simple application aimed at exploring various techniques involved in the secure transmission of data over insecure networks. This project involves topics such as networking techniques, authentication and validation, and public key cryptography.
- [StabilityMachine](https://skadoot.github.io/): A very early stage project that aims to build a small four-wheeled robot with two motors rotating on both the horizontal and vertical axes, capable of stabilising a specific point in space, or focusing on a location; think stabilised camera rig, or tank turret.

## Career Aspirations

I am deeply fascinated by the defense industry and aspire to contribute to the development of modern defense systems. I closely follow organisations like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and more. My goal is to develop and leverage my skills in software development and cybersecurity to make a meaningful impact in this exciting and dynamic field.
