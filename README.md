## 🚗 Car Enthusiast

In my spare time, I trade my keyboard for a wrench and delve into the world of mechanics. My trusty '90 Mazda MX5 is my project, and I love DIY projects that let me uncover the secrets under the hood.

## 🌍 Multilingual

Fluent in English and Welsh, I'm also challenging myself to learn German. It's not just about mastering code; languages open up new horizons too.

## 🎵 Music Enthusiast

I'm not just passionate about code and cars; I'm also a huge music enthusiast. I find inspiration in the works of composers like Hans Zimmer, Hildur Guonadottir, Volker Bertelmann, Ludovico Einaudi, and Max Richter. Their music has a unique way of complementing my coding and automotive adventures, setting the perfect backdrop for my creative endeavors.

Whether I'm debugging a complex piece of code or fine-tuning my car's performance, their compositions provide the soundtrack to my journey. I believe that the harmony in technology, mechanics, and music is what fuels my passion for exploration.

## 🌱 Always Learning

I'm fueled by a great curiosity to understand how things work. Whether it's pulling apart car engines or diving into software architecture, I'm driven by the desire to unravel the inner workings of our world. Exploring the intricate details is not just a hobby; it's my way of learning, and it keeps me excited about every project I take on. Join me on this journey of discovery! 🚀
