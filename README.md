# Shwmae! 👋

I'm Skadoot, a CompSci graduate working on software and web development in my spare time. I'm interested in web design and UX, as well as secure software solutions, encryption, and cryptography.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- 🚀 Experience with: Java, Kotlin, Android, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- 🛠️ Tools I use: Maven, Gradle, JetBrains Suite, Android Studio
- 🌐 Currently exploring: Secure software systems, Cryptography, Machine Learning & AI, C++, and C#

## 🚧 Current Projects

- [skadoot.github.io](https://skadoot.github.io/): My portfolio website, at the moment it's a placeholder, with a more complete and fully-featured site in the works.
- [ChatMachine](https://skadoot.github.io/ChatMachine): A very early stage project that aims to re-envision modular software, and open-source communications; by providing a robust, modular, adaptable, and scalable solution for secure communications in a variety of settings.

## 🧠 Interests

I love clasical music and OSTs. I'm a big fan of composers such as Hans Zimmer, Ludovico Einaudi, Max Richter, and more. I'm also into cars and mechanics, I currently own a Mazda MX5 that I love to work on in my spare time, and I've taught myself a lot about maintaining cars since I've owned it. I particularly enjoy creative hands on things where I can learn about how something works, fix things, or be creative.

## 📅 Availability

I'm hoping to find some new FOSS projects to contribute to, and learn more about. If you have a project that needs help in some way, I'd love to get involved.

Unfortunately, I am not currently accepting any new commercial web development clients.
